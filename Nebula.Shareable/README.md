# Introduction
- Nebula.Executor can load  and execute the compiled '.neb' files. To execute any compiled file start the application through
the windows command line terminal and pass as arguments the file paths of the compiled files you want to exetue.

- Nebula.Compiler can compile one or more '.nebula' scripts from a command line terminal. Use the command '/?' to get an help script. Multiple files can be provided as well as precompiled references.

- Nebula.Editor allows for syntax-highlighting and error reporting while editing Nebula scripts. The Editor currently supports compilation of a single script at a time but dependencies can be included in the configuration options.
